# Airbnb-Price-Prediction
* This is an end to end project which uses the airbnb Melbourne dataset and builds a prediction model to predict the price of the listing using many variables. 
* The dataset used is here is available on insideairbnb website. Melbourne dataset.
* The data is cleaned to use only the important variables to predict the price of the listing.
* Most of the functions written are self explanatory and easy to understand.
* Categorical variables are encoded using one hot encoder.
* Scaling of the variables is done.
* Some of the outliers are removed.

* Different files and folder descriptions are as follow:
* listings.csv - Data used for the model.
* airbnb_price_prediction.ipnb - A jupter notebbok file containing the code for the model and the cleaning steps followed.
* airbnb_price_prediction.py - A python file of the same ipnb code.
* data.csv - Data saved after performing the necessary pre processing steps.

* Future work:
* Different classifiers are being tested and added when they have a decent accuracy.
* Base classifier used is linear regression, and artifical neural networks is used to predict the price.
* Planned future classifiers: Random Forests, Decision Trees, Ensemble techniques and Naive Bayes.
